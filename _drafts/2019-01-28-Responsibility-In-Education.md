# Education Models

Upon visiting different countries and seeing their schools, it becomes
clear that not everyone approaches education the same way. Likewise,
reviewing the different mediums of education, we find different approaches
to education. Let's look into a couple general examples:

## On the Job Training

Most of us are familiar with this form of education. My first job was at
Subway, where I went through a two week training period before working at
a restaurant where I was expected to fulfill full responsibilities. Being
my first job, I didn't have experience running a register, making food, or
much of interaction with customers.

The focus of the on-the-job training is to overcome the unique challenges
that exist in the workplace. For example, at Subway I had to memorize the
"formulas" for what to put on a sandwich, for example, we placed eight
slices of ham on the black-forest ham sandwich. Similarly, software
companies have their own formulas, such as CI/CD practices, style guides,
architectures, languages, etc. On the job training for an entry-level
position overcomes these.

This form of education focuses on skills and results. We need to quickly
develop the requisite skills to perform the task, and if we don't, we fail.
There is an element of "partial credit" as perfection doesn't determine
passing, but at the same time, perfection vs completion doesn't play as
significant a role as most people think with a short-term view

The significance with this form of education is the amount of personal
responsibility required. No one else can learn the skills for you and it
becomes very clear very quickly what you do or don't know. Likewise, most
people like this method of learning and how quickly they learn while
working. Responsibility lies at the heart of this learning. When we put
in the effort to learn, we get the most out of it.

## Grade-based Learning

Grades are evil in many ways. The big problem is, how do we give accurate
feedback and motivation without them? How can we indicate progress and
proficiency without some sort of scoring mechanism? Therefore, grades are
useful, albeit evil.

The main problem with Grades is the displacement of motivation. Students
no longer work for knowledge, but work for their "salary" or grades.

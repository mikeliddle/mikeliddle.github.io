# Why do a Startup?

I recently took a class on software engineering at my college, where the
teacher poignantly said, "You should each have two jobs before you get set
in your career path: one with a startup, and one with an established
software company."[^1] I had already decided this on my own, but I liked
the way he phrased it, and wanted to share this advice to others.

In 2017, my brother decided to start his own company before graduating and
had the idea of TrashTalk. TrashTalk uses ultrasonic sensors to measure
the fill-level of trashcans and report that data to a cloud service. The
idea is that companies have very inefficient waste collection systems and
knowing the fill-level of trashcans could improve that. An estimated 30%
of all collection efforts industry wide are unnecessary. In other words,
in a $5 billion collection industry, people are wasting $1.5 billion where
a solution exists.[^2]

My brother graduated with in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in
Business Strategy. This gave him a great knowledge-advantage in starting a
company that focused on IoT technology, since he had enough electronics
experience to design and build the sensors, sufficient programming
knowledge to get the sensor working, and enough business knowledge to
formulate a good Lean canvas, know how to sell well, and how to manage a
startup. With a passion for his problem, he was able to sign quite a few
companies on as early-adopters, some paying him to manage their solution,
others just letting him do research with their containers. The thing that
he discovered he was missing was the software to support his product.

In a world where you can access nearly everything from your phone, people
expected a mobile platform to see their trashcans from. That's how I got
roped into TrashTalk. With a basic knowledge of programming, a drive to
learn, and previous experience with helping him debug code, he thought I
would make a great co-founder. I did help him, not as a co-founder, but
as an unpaid consultant, and have filled that role for nearly two years
now.

Here's what to look for when deciding to work for a startup.

## 1. What do you want out of it

The first question you should ask yourself is, "What do I need right now?"
In my case, it was money and my brother was refusing VC funding, so he
was not in a position to pay me. I had to reject a role as co-founder as a
result. But that didn't stop me from working with him. If you are needing
significant amounts of money, don't expect that at a startup unless they
have significant contracts, or Venture Capitalist funding. Rarely, if ever,
do you come to an early startup where they have enough money to pay you
how much you're worth. You can get equity, which will pay-off in the long
run, if you can wait that long. If the startup is better established, you
should expect payment, probably to your worth, and you will still have
the "startup experience."

The next thing I needed was practical experience building a software
product. Startups provide a great resource for this since you are not
divided up into a bunch of teams maintaining and "feature-boosting" an
existing product. You are the creator. You are the QA department. You
are the graphic designer. You are the database administrator. You are the
one-man band. You need to be very Agile in your development, and at any
point, what you have spent your time building may be thrown aside for
customer needs.

As Steve Blank phrases it, a startup is "a temporary organization designed
to search for a repeatable and scalable business model."[^3] Therefore,
you may start working in one industry and end up somewhere completely
different as you conduct your search. The biggest thing I gained from
working with TrashTalk would later be taught to me again at Microsoft:
Build only products that will make a difference to your customer. If you
are in a startup that isn't customer-centric, get out quick! You'll be
doing the company, and yourself, a favor by leaving.

## 3 When to get into a startup

This can be a tricky question. Let's assume I am pursuing a 4-year degree
in Computer Science with a standard Fall/Winter schedule. That gives you an
internship for your sophomore year, and Junior year, with potential for one
senior year (although most companies don't like that).

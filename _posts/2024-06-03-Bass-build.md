## The Creamsicle Bass

I've played the bass for quite a while but I've been primarily playing on an Ibanez SR300E. For those familiar with this bass, its a great budget option for beginners and has a variety of tones you can get out of it by splitting the pickups, balancing them, and using an active pre-amp. As I played more and more, however, I realized I wanted a good P-Bass tone. I'm also a big fan of the Jaguar basses and so I decided to start looking at Jaguars. I found the Fender Player series Jaguars, which are very nice instruments, however, I couldn't quite justify paying the $800 to get it. Since I like woodworking (I'm not good at it, but I like it), I decided to build my own bass. I found a kit by Vibeworks on Amazon and Ebay that had a paddle headstock I could shape, and a body similar to a Jaguar, so I decided to go for it.

The Creamsicle theme is paying homage to my Grandpa Walker. I have fond memories from my childhood eating creamsicles with him in the summer and it reminds me of a time before I had the responsibilities, anxieties, and life problems that I now deal with. I still love creamsicles today and like the idea of a fun, childish theme for my bass, so it was decided. I picked up some orange spray paint from Home Depot, a couple of clear coat options, and set to work.

### Headstock Shape

The first thing I had to do was figure out how to shape the paddle headstock. I was hoping I could cut it down to have the tuners on alternating sides, like an acoustic guitar, since I was worried about weight distribution with such a light body. As I started templating the shape with paper, it became apparent that this wouldn't look good on this bass. I didn't have enough wood on the end to feel comfortable with the tuners mounted the way they are. So ultimately, I went with a classic looking headstock that would kind of be a mix between a standard Fender bass and a Telecaster. I used a jigsaw to cut the shape and then sanded it smooth. I'm happy with how it turned out.

### Sanding Purgatory

When I got the bass, I was prepared to do all the finishing work myself. I assumed (correctly) that a rough sanding would be done on everything, so I would want to prep it for painting by sanding it finer and fixing rough machined patches. I got the kit in the winter, so it was perfect. I setup in my garage and got to work sanding the body all the way up to 400 grit. There were several rough patches, but the biggest win from this was how smooth everything got.
